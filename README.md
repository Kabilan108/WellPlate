WellPlate is a Python-based interface designed using the `PyQt5` framework to allow for the seamless management of 96-well and 384-well plates by providing a user-friendly GUI.

WellPlate was developed based on the Model View Controller design pattern.
In summary, the MVC pattern for GUI applications consists of:
    - The user performing an action or request (event) on the view(GUI)
    - The view notifies the controller about the user's action.
    - The controller gets the user's request and queries the model for a response.
    - The model processes the controller querry, performs the required operations, and returns an answer or result.
    - The controller receives the model's answer and updates the view accordingly.
    - The user finnally sees the requested result as an update on the view.
